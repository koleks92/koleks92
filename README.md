💻 I’m a developer passionate about building web and mobile applications, working with both frontend and backend technologies.

🐍 I mostly code in Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript — but I still enjoy exploring other languages like C++ and C.

🎬 Outside of coding, I’m into swimming, cinematography, and music, and I love learning new languages (not just programming ones!).

🚀 Currently improving my full-stack skills and looking to collaborate on something creative — inspire me!
